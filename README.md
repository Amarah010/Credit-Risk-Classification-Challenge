# Credit Risk Classification Challenge

# Analysis Report 

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to use various techniques to train and evaluate the accuracy of a model that predicts the credity worthiness of potential borrowers using data from a peer-to-peer lending services company. 

The process for this analysis is as follows:
* Splitting the data into training and test sets
* Creating a Logistic Regression Model
* Evaluating the models' performance 

## Results

* Balanced Accuracy Score: 99% 
* Precision Score: 92%
* Recall Score: 95% 

## Summary

I would recommend using this model to predict the credit worthiness of borrowers, because it has a 99% accuracy in predicting the outcome of the repayment of the initial loan.
