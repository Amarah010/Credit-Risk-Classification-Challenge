# Analysis Report 

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to use various techniques to train and evaluate the accuracy of a model that predicts the credity worthiness of potential borrowers using data from a peer-to-peer lending services company. 

The process for this analysis is as follows:
* Splitting the data into training and test sets
* Creating a Logistic Regression Model
* Evaluating the models' performance 

* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
    * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
